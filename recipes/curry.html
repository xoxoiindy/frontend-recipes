Season the vegetables with salt and cook over high heat for about 4 minutes. Lower the heat and cover with a lid.  Steam for another 4 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Open the lid and add in the curry powder and flour. Cook it for one minute. Add water, apple juice, soup stock powder and cooked beans. Once it comes to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for an additional 5 minutes with the lid on until all the vegetables are cooked. Season the curry with soy sauce and miso paste. Adjust the final taste with salt if it’s needed.</ol>
    <ol>Cook the udon noodles according to their package instructions. Transfer the cooked noodles to a serving bowl then pour the soup (step 3) over top. </ol>
