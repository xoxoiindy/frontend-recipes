    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>Thinly slice the onion, leeks, carrots, and shiitake mushrooms. Set aside. Chop the Napa cabbage into bite size pieces. Remove excess oil from the fried tofu by pressing them with a piece of paper towel then cut them into strips. Mince the garlic. Grind the toasted sesame seeds.</ol>
    <ol>To a pot, add all the vegetables you just chopped (step 1), and 200ml water, mirin, cooking sake and soup stock powder. Bring it to a boil over high heat. Once it comes to a boil, cover with a lid and cook it on low for 15 mins.
    </ol>
    <ol>Open the lid then add in the fried tofu, frozen udon noodles, spinach and grated lotus root. Add the remaining water. Just before it comes back to a boil, remove from heat. Dissolve in the miso paste and add in the soy sauce. Serve the udon soup in a bowl with the ground toasted sesame seeds and chopped green onions. </ol>
